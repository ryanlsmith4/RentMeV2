Welcome to the RentMe! RentMe's vision is to create a space for renters and tenants to come together to become friends and leave as family. Its core goal is to make life easier for good tenants and good renters. It's was founded in 2018 by Alex Bogart, Then punted towards an actual project by Ryan Smith in late 2018. With high aspirations, we want to create something meaningful and streamline the whole process of finding a place to stay, pay rent, have your rights as a tenant and renter all in one place, and get your daily needs taken care of ie. "My sink is leaking I should tell my landlord about it and get it fixed". All while allowing the renter and tenant to establish a relationship through a rating system so when the tenant who you love moves on you have a much easier time finding a new one to care about just the same.
If you have something you'd like to contribute just do a PR and i'll review it and decide if it's a great addition!
